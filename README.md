# Beam Steering Beamformer

This repository contains a basic implementation of a beam steering beamformer algorithm in Python. Beamforming is a signal processing technique used to enhance the signal coming from a specific direction while suppressing interference from other directions. In this example, we'll demonstrate a simple delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm.

## Getting Started

To use this beamforming code, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
4. Open the `beamformer.py` file and modify the parameters as needed:

- `frequency`: The frequency of the signal in Hz.
- `duration`: The duration of the generated signal in seconds.
- `sample_rate`: The sample rate in samples per second.
- `steering_angle`: The desired steering angle in degrees.
- `array_positions`: Define the positions of the microphones in the array.

5. Run the `beamformer.py` script using the following command:

6. The beamformed signal will be generated and can be further analyzed or played.

## Algorithm Overview

The beamforming algorithm in this example is a simplified delay-and-sum beamformer. It calculates time delays based on microphone positions and applies these delays to align signals before summing them up. The goal is to enhance the signal coming from a specific direction while attenuating signals from other directions.

## Customization and Extensions

This code provides a basic demonstration of beamforming. Depending on your specific use case and hardware setup, you may need to consider the following:

- Calibration: Proper calibration of microphone positions and sensitivities is essential for accurate beamforming.
- Filtering: Applying filters can help improve the signal quality and reduce noise.
- Room Acoustics: Room reflections and acoustic properties may impact the beamforming performance.
- Real-time Processing: For real-time applications, consider optimizing the code for speed.

Feel free to customize and extend this code to suit your requirements. For more advanced beamforming techniques and implementations, consider consulting relevant literature and experts in the field.
